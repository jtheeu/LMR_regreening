# LMR_regreening
The scripts for the data analysis of our manuscript are included in this script. 


The script plot_recycling_yearly_LMR_med_regions.py plots the local moisture recycling ratio for the five major Mediterranean regions. It also plots the study regions in each plot. To do this the file shapefile_mediterranean.shp is used. This file is also located in this repository.
